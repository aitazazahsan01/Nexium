## AI Recipe Generator
A modern, full-stack web application that leverages AI to generate unique recipes based on user-provided ingredients. This project was developed as the Final Project for the Nexium Remote Internship.

## Author: Muhammad Aitazaz Ahsan (Student of NUST)

## Live Deployment: https://nexium-ai-recipe-generator-five.vercel.app/

## 📝 Project Description
The AI Recipe Generator is designed to solve the common problem of "what can I make with what I have?". Users can input a list of ingredients they have on hand, specify any dietary restrictions, and receive a complete, creative recipe generated by Google's Gemini AI. The application features a full user authentication system and allows users to save their favorite generated recipes to a personal, persistent recipe book.

This project demonstrates a complete development lifecycle, from local setup and debugging to a fully functional CI/CD deployment on Vercel.

## ✨ Key Features
AI-Powered Recipe Generation: Utilizes Google's Gemini model via an n8n workflow to create recipes from scratch.

Secure User Authentication: Implements passwordless magic link login using Supabase Auth.

Persistent Data Storage: Saves user accounts and generated recipes in a Supabase PostgreSQL database.

Dynamic & Animated Frontend: A beautiful, responsive, and fully animated user interface built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

Interactive UI: Features include an animated splash screen, a detailed recipe modal view, and interactive UI elements.

CI/CD Deployment: Automatically deployed and updated via Vercel connected to the main GitHub branch.

## 🚀 Tech Stack
Frontend: Next.js (React Framework)

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Animations: Framer Motion

Backend & Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)

AI Logic & Automation: n8n.io (Workflow Automation)

AI Model: Google Gemini

Deployment: Vercel

***⚙️Getting Started & Local Setup*** 
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

## 1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/aitazazahsan01/Nexium.git
cd Nexium/"Final Project"/recipe-generator

## 2. Install Dependencies
npm install

## 3. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a file named .env.local in the root of the recipe-generator directory and add the following variables. You will need to get these keys from your own Supabase and n8n accounts.

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=YOUR_N8N_PRODUCTION_WEBHOOK_URL

## 4. Set Up Supabase
Create a project on Supabase.

Use the SQL Editor to create your recipes table and set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure users can only access their own data.

In the Authentication -> URL Configuration section, set the Site URL to http://localhost:3000 for local development.

## 5. Set Up n8n
Set up a workflow that is triggered by a webhook.

The workflow should call the Google Gemini API with a prompt to generate a recipe title and text based on the incoming ingredients.

Ensure the workflow responds with the generated JSON.

## 6. Run the Development Server
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the result.
