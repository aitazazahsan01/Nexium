üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally on your machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or later)

A free Supabase account

A free MongoDB Atlas account

npm or yarn package manager

**1. Clone the Repository**
Bash

git clone https://github.com/aitazazahsan01/Nexium.git
cd Nexium
**2. Install Dependencies**
Bash

npm install
**3. Set Up Environment Variables**
Create a new file named .env.local in the root of your project directory and add the following variables.

Code snippet

# Supabase - Get from Project Settings > API
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

# MongoDB - Get from Database > Connect > Drivers
MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_CONNECTION_STRING
MONGODB_DB_NAME=blog_data
Note: For the MONGODB_URI, make sure to replace <password> with your actual database user password.

**4. Set Up Databases**
Supabase
Go to your Supabase project dashboard.

Navigate to the SQL Editor.

Click New query and run the following script to create the summaries table:

SQL

CREATE TABLE summaries (
  id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY,
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  url TEXT NOT NULL,
  summary_en TEXT,
  summary_ur TEXT
);
MongoDB
No setup is required other than creating a free cluster on MongoDB Atlas. The database (blog_data) and collection (full_texts) will be created automatically when the first document is inserted.

Important: Ensure you have configured Network Access in MongoDB Atlas to allow connections from your local IP and from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) for Vercel deployment.

**5. Run the Development Server**
Now you can start the local development server.

Bash

npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application running.

**üåê Deployment
**This project is deployed on Vercel. Any push to the main branch on GitHub will automatically trigger a new deployment, ensuring continuous integration and delivery.
